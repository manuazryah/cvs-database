                <p><strong>How we work</strong></p>
                <p>The Website is intended to be used by people  seeking employment ("Jobseekers") or businesses looking to recruit Jobseekers ("Employers") to carry out certain functions and tasks and to gain a corporate learning experience (“Job Opportunity”). We offer information, support and Services strictly in accordance with these Terms and Conditions.</p>
                <p>We provide information to employers seeking to recruit Jobseekers which includes access to our curriculum vitae database (CVs Database). There is no charge for access to Jobseekers as a Jobseeker and all Website access will remain free for registered Jobseekers (unless a Service offered specifically states otherwise).</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Jobseekers specifically acknowledge and agree to the following:</strong></p>
                <p>you will only submit your CV to the Website and will not contact any Employer directly or indirectly by any other means;</p>
                <p>you will provide us with any information reasonably requested by us or an Employer in connection with your CV;</p>
                <p>your engagement or employment by an Employer will be subject to such terms as may be agreed between you and the Employer. We shall not be party to any such terms, nor shall we held liable for any damage or detriment caused to either the Employer or the employee as a result of entering into any such agreement. Although we encourage Employers to put legal and written contracts in place with Jobseekers we accept no liability in relation to any such contract or any Employer's failure to enter into such a contract. Furthermore, we shall have no liability if an Employer, having made a verbal or written offer to you, then fails to employ or engage you in accordance with such offer;</p>
                <p>you will not represent yourself as an employee or agent of us to any person, including an Employer, unless this is specifically agreed by us in writing;</p>
                <p>if you have any questions about any Career Opportunity offer you receive from an Employer you should seek independent legal advice or you may speak with one of our consultants. However, any advice offered to by our consultant(s) must be deemed as merely guidance and not instructions which have to be followed;</p>
                <p>and we and/or any Employer may request or make a background check that covers your academic qualifications, professional history, and/or references.</p>

                <p>We do not accept liability as an Employer of any Jobseekers.

Any Employer who agrees to use the Website or our Services/ Employer Assistance warrants that we will not have any responsibility or liability in relation to the terms of their employment or contracting an arrangement with any Jobseekers. Employers acknowledge that the nature and frequency of any work performed by a Jobseeker on their behalf could result in the Jobseekers being classified as an employee of the Employer.
